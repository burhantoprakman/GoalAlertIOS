It will notify you of the following: \n1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the application, how it is used and with whom it may be shared. \n2. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data. \n3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information. \n4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. \nWe are the sole owners of the information collected on this application. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. \nUnless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy. \nYou may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our application: \n• See what data we have about you, if any. \n• Change/correct any data we have about you. \n• Have us delete any data we have about you. \n• Express any concern you have about our use of your data. \nWe take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the application, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for https at the beginning of the address of the Web page. \nWhile we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. \nIn order to use this application, a user may be asked to complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address).

At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself. \nWe request information from you on our order form. To buy any service from us, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we\'ll use this information to contact you. \nWe use cookies on this application. A cookie is a piece of data stored on an application visitor\'s hard drive to help us improve your access to our application and identify repeat visitors to our application.

However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. \nWe share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. \nWe may use third party companies to serve orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order. \nWe partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. \nThis application contains links to other websites or applications. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites or applications. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our application and to read the privacy statements of any other websites or applications that collects personally identifiable information. \nFrom time-to-time our application requests information via surveys or contests.
